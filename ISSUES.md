### UI/UX issues

#### Roaming UX

- In the roaming bottom sheet, there should be a "generate" button on the left of "start", that generates the road and trace it on the map **without** starting the actual route. clicking "generate" again regenerate the road, we can add a random offset to the location and radius (nothing major like 2% of their actual value) so it can be different
- When roaming is started, the icon should become green, clicking on it expands it like we do for the floating widget route icon when started. it should be treaded like a route so we should be able to start/pause/stop the roaming.

### Bug

- After starting roaming with spoofing disabled (which shouldn't be possible, roaming should be disabled if spoof isn't enabled), we are not able anymore to "start" spoofing, the icon remains green and stuck, even after we close the app, I'm not sure what is the exact location of the issue, investigate.
