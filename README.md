No-root mock location app for Android. Spoof GPS anywhere using floating joystick, saved routes, and OSM-powered roaming — without touching system partition.

---

## What is locationjoystick?

GPS spoofing app built on Android's official mock location API. No root, no Xposed, no system mods. Enable Developer Options, pick locationjoystick as mock location provider → device believes it's wherever you say.

Primary use case: location-based games like Pokémon GO. Walk saved routes, roam a neighborhood automatically, or nudge position with floating joystick while game runs in foreground. App keeps spoofing in background.

Also useful for: privacy (mask real location), QA testing (simulate movement at desk), development (test geofences, location triggers, map features).

## Features

- **Map**: OpenStreetMap via MapLibre (GPU-accelerated, offline-capable). Tap to walk or teleport. Spoofed position as live marker.
- **Joystick**: Floating overlay, stays on top of any app. Move any direction at chosen speed. Draggable. Persists while minimized.
- **Speeds**: Walk (2 km/h) / Run (10 km/h) / Bike (20 km/h) presets. Each user-editable. Anti-cheat warning shown inline when speed exceeds 8 m/s. Accessible from floating widget.
- **Routes**: Two modes — **straight** (direct segments, no network) and **guided** (OSRM road-following). Create waypoints on map. Save/rename/edit/delete. Replay, loop, or record in real time.
- **Roaming**: Set radius + duration. Auto-walks randomly. Optional road-following via OSRM.
- **Favorites**: Save named map positions. Instantly teleport to any.
- **Floating Widget**: Configurable quick-access panel floats over other apps. Collapsible.
- **Background**: Spoofs while minimized or screen off via foreground service. Low-priority notification.
- **Import/Export**: All settings to/from JSON (routes, favorites, speed presets, widget config).

## Download

Pre-built APKs on [Releases page](https://github.com/locationjoystick/locationjoystick/releases).

Sideload:

```bash
adb install locationjoystick-vX.X.X.apk
```

Or transfer APK to device and open with file manager (allow installs from unknown sources).

## Setup Guide

### Step 1 — Enable Developer Options

Settings → About phone → tap **Build number** seven times → Developer Options unlocked.

### Step 2 — Select Mock Location App

Settings → System → Developer Options → **Select mock location app** → choose **locationjoystick**.

### Step 3 — Grant Overlay Permission

Open locationjoystick → tap **Grant Permission** → find locationjoystick in list → enable toggle → return to app.

### Step 4 — Start Spoofing

Open locationjoystick → tap map to teleport or use joystick → open target app → locationjoystick keeps running in background.

> **Note:** Some apps detect mock locations. Check the app's community for current workarounds.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog or newer (or JDK + Android SDK command-line tools)
- Java 17
- Android SDK with API 31+

### Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/locationjoystick/locationjoystick.git
cd locationjoystick
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Debug APK at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Release build

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions builds, signs, uploads APK to GitHub Releases on tag push.

## Architecture

Multi-module NowInAndroid-style. Each feature = Gradle module. Shared code in `:core:*`.

```
feature/*        — UI + ViewModels (Compose screens, no business logic)
  ↓ depends on
core/data        — Repositories (single source of truth)
  ↓
core/database    — Room DB
core/datastore   — DataStore Prefs

core/location    — Mock GPS engine (ForegroundService), independent of UI
core/model       — Pure Kotlin data classes, no Android deps
```

MVVM + Repository. ViewModels expose `StateFlow`/`SharedFlow`. Compose collects via `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`. Hilt DI throughout. Single `NavHost` in `MainActivity`.

### Modules

Each feature split into `:api` (public contract) + `:impl` (implementation).

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `:app` | Entry point, Hilt setup, NavGraph |
| `:core:common` | Utilities, extensions, constants |
| `:core:data` | Repositories, DataStore preferences |
| `:core:database` | Room DB, DAOs, entities |
| `:core:datastore` | DataStore preferences source |
| `:core:designsystem` | Design tokens, theme, typography |
| `:core:location` | Mock GPS foreground service + movement engine |
| `:core:model` | Pure Kotlin domain data classes |
| `:core:overlay` | Shared WindowManager overlay utilities |
| `:core:routing` | OSRM client + route interpolation |
| `:core:testing` | Shared test utilities, fakes |
| `:core:ui` | Shared Compose components |
| `:feature:favorites:api` / `:impl` | Favorites list, MapPicker, teleport |
| `:feature:joystick:api` / `:impl` | Floating joystick overlay service |
| `:feature:map:api` / `:impl` | MapLibre screen, map interactions |
| `:feature:roaming:api` / `:impl` | Roaming config, RoamingEngine |
| `:feature:routes:api` / `:impl` | Route list, editor, replay |
| `:feature:settings:api` / `:impl` | Speed profiles, widget config, export/import |
| `:feature:setup:api` / `:impl` | Multi-step onboarding flow |
| `:feature:widget:api` / `:impl` | Floating widget overlay service |
