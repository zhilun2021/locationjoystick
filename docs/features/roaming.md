# Roaming Mode

Set a center, radius, and distance. Walks randomly within the radius. Configured via bottom sheet on the Map screen.

Key files: `:core:routing/RoamingEngine.kt`, `:core:routing/OsrmClient.kt`, `:core:data/RoamingRepository.kt`, `:feature:map:impl/MapBottomSheets.kt`, `:feature:map:impl/MapViewModel.kt`

## Modes

- **Simple** (straight-line): no network required.
- **Road-following** (OSRM routes): opt-in. On OSRM failure, the affected segment falls back to a straight line automatically; already-planned road segments are kept.

## Algorithm

The entire route is pre-planned before walking begins. The map shows the complete wandering path upfront rather than updating per-segment.

**Waypoint count**: `numPoints = max(2, round(distanceMeters * 30 / 1000))` — scales linearly (1000 m → 30 points).

**Straight-line mode**: All waypoints generated upfront. With `returnToInitialLocation`, the second half mirrors back toward center with the center appended as the final point.

**Road-following mode (OSRM)**: Picks random points iteratively, fetches OSRM segments, accumulates road distance until budget is met (safety cap: 50 OSRM calls). With `returnToInitialLocation`, a final OSRM segment from the last point back to center is fetched. Always requests the foot profile (never the speed profile's transport mode) — see OSRM Configuration below. If an individual segment request fails, only that segment falls back to a straight line (haversine distance counted toward the budget) — road segments already fetched earlier in the route are kept, not discarded.

**Preview = planning**: `generateRoamingPreview` runs the full planning algorithm. `startRoaming` walks the pre-planned route directly. If no preview exists at start time, planning runs inline.

## Configuration Fields (`RoamingConfig`)

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `centerPosition` | Center of the roaming area |
| `radiusMeters` | Radius of the random walk area |
| `distanceMeters` | Total distance to walk before stopping |
| `speedProfileId` | Movement speed only — does not affect OSRM profile selection |
| `useRoadSnapping` | Enables OSRM road-following |
| `returnToInitialLocation` | Walk back to center after roaming completes |

`RoamingConfig` is constructed from `RoamingDefaults` via `RoamingDefaults.toConfig(centerPosition)` — the single translation site for `followRoads → useRoadSnapping`.

## OSRM Configuration

Base URL, overview, geometries, and profile constants in `AppConstants.OsrmConstants` and `AppConstants.RoamingConstants`.

All road-following OSRM requests (roaming, walk-via-roads, route creator, ephemeral replay) always use the foot profile. If OSRM returns `NoSegment` (a waypoint too far from any road, e.g. tapped on water or an unmapped area), `OsrmClient` snaps every waypoint to its nearest road node via the OSRM `/nearest` endpoint and retries once before any further fallback. If a foot-profile request still fails, it retries once with the driving profile before the caller falls back to a straight line — this only changes behavior on an OSRM backend with separate profile graphs; the public `router.project-osrm.org` demo serves a single graph regardless of profile name.

### Reliability: Retry, Bisection, and Failure Reporting

The public `router.project-osrm.org` demo server has no SLA and can throttle, error, or time out unpredictably — worse in high-traffic areas. `OsrmClient` mitigates this in three ways:

- **Classified failures**: every OSRM failure is classified into `OsrmFailureReason` (`Timeout`, `ServerError`, `NoRouteFound`, `NetworkUnavailable`, `Unknown`) by exception type, never by parsing message strings.
- **Generic retry**: `Timeout`, `ServerError`, and `NetworkUnavailable` are retried up to `AppConstants.OsrmConstants.RETRY_COUNT` times with a short fixed backoff (`RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`) before any fallback chain runs. `NoRouteFound` is never retried — a genuinely-no-route response won't change on retry.
- **Bisection for long legs**: a single A→B request beyond `AppConstants.OsrmConstants.BISECTION_MIN_DISTANCE_METERS` that still fails is split at the midpoint and each half resolved independently (recursively, up to `BISECTION_MAX_DEPTH`), in parallel, bounded by `BISECTION_TIME_BUDGET_MS` via coroutine cancellation (not polling). Sub-legs that fail even after exhausting depth fall back to a straight line. To keep total request volume bounded against the shared demo server, only shallow bisection leaves (`BISECTION_RETRY_DEPTH_CUTOFF`) get retries — deeper leaves are one-shot.

`RoamingEngine`'s legs are short enough to stay below the bisection threshold by construction, so roaming continues to rely on its own per-segment straight-line fallback (`fetchSegmentOrFallback`) rather than bisection.

**User-visible errors**: `RoutingErrorReporter` (`:core:routing`, `@Singleton`) is a shared channel for routing failures, replacing the previous per-`MapController` flow. `MapController.walkViaRoads` reports a reason-specific message (e.g. "Routing server unavailable — using straight walk") instead of a generic one. `RoamingEngine.planRoadFollowingRoute` tracks how many planned segments fell back to straight-line and, if any did, emits one summary message after planning completes (e.g. "Road-following partially unavailable — 3 of 9 legs used straight-line paths") instead of staying silent.

## State Management

- `RoamingRepository` owns `isRoaming` and `isRoamingPaused` `StateFlow`s.
- `RoamingEngine` owns `activeJob` and the coroutine scope. Only one session active at a time — starting a new one awaits cancellation of the previous via `cancelAndJoin` before movement begins.
- Completion (natural loop exit) fires `onComplete` callback → `RoamingRepository` resets mode and clears route waypoints.
