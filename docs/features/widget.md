# Floating Widget

Small floating button overlay. Tap to expand a panel with configured quick-access controls. Items configured in Settings.

Key files: `:feature:widget:impl/FloatingWidgetService.kt`, `:feature:settings:impl/SettingsScreen.kt`

## Mechanism

- Same overlay mechanism as the joystick via `:core:overlay`.
- Separate service, toggled independently of the joystick.
- State transitions: collapsed (FAB) ↔ expanded (panel) via `ValueAnimator`.
- Enabled features stored in DataStore as `stringSetPreferencesKey`; the shared display order (see below) is a separate `stringPreferencesKey`.

## Configurability

Both the widget panel and the map screen's FAB column render the same `AppFeature` set (`:core:model/AppFeature.kt`), each feature declaring which surface(s) — `WIDGET`, `MAP`, or both — it's eligible for. Settings → Menus → "App Features" shows one combined, drag-to-reorder list: a drag handle, a checkbox to show on the widget (if eligible), and a checkbox to show on the map (if eligible).

A single shared `featureOrder` list controls display order on both surfaces, so they stay consistent by default — the user can still diverge enablement per surface, just not relative order. `SettingsRepository.getWidgetFeatures()` / `getMapFeatures()` filter+sort that shared order by each surface's enabled set.

## Service Lifecycle

- Binds to `MockLocationService` in `onStartCommand`.
- Unbinds in `onDestroy`.

## Completion Badge

A red dot appears at the top-right of the widget FAB when a route, walk, or roaming session ends naturally (completion, not user-initiated stop). The badge is driven by `pendingCompletionFlow: MutableStateFlow<Boolean>` in `FloatingWidgetService`, set on `mapController.completionMessages` emission.

- **Trigger**: any natural completion event (route replay end, walk-to arrival, roaming loop end).
- **Cleared**: when the user taps the FAB to expand the panel (`isPanelExpandedFlow` becomes `true`).
- **Does not appear**: when the user manually stops a session.

## Floating Map — Route Controls

When `AppFeature.MAP_FLOATING` is enabled, the floating map's FAB column includes a route button:

- **Shown when**: `AppFeature.ROUTES` is enabled for the map surface in Settings **or** a route replay is currently active.
- **Active state**: route icon turns green (`LjSuccess`) during `ROUTE_REPLAY` mode.
- **Expand controls**: tapping the route button expands two inline buttons to the left:
  - **Stop** — ends the replay immediately.
  - **Pause / Resume** — toggles replay pause state.
- **Settings gate**: `enabledMapFeatures` flows through `MapSharedState` so the floating map respects the same visibility toggle as the main map screen.

## Edge Cases

- No items configured → show placeholder.
- Clamp panel to screen bounds.
- Re-clamp on `onConfigurationChanged`.
