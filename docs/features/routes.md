# Route System

Waypoints on map → polyline. Save, edit, replay, loop, record real-time.

Key files: `:feature:routes:impl/RoutesScreen.kt`, `:feature:routes:impl/RouteCreatorScreen.kt`, `:feature:routes:impl/RoutesViewModel.kt`, `:core:database/RouteDao.kt`, `:core:routing/RouteReplayEngine.kt`

## Route Types

- **STRAIGHT** (`RouteType.STRAIGHT`): straight segments, no network.
- **GUIDED** (`RouteType.GUIDED`): OSRM road-following. On fail → `osrmError = true` in `CreatorState`. No silent fallback.

## Storage

`RouteEntity` + `WaypointEntity` one-to-many. Waypoints: `routeId`, `lat`, `lon`, `orderIndex`. Query via `@Transaction @Query` → `Flow<RouteWithWaypoints>`.

Routes can also be imported from GPX files via the Routes screen overflow menu → "Import GPX". Max file size: 10 MB. Parsed and saved as `RouteType.STRAIGHT` routes.

## Replay

- Interpolate waypoints at speed (m/s).
- Bearing via `atan2`.
- Advance: `speed * deltaTime`.
- Snap at `AppConstants.LocationConstants.WALK_ARRIVAL_THRESHOLD_METERS`.
- Loop: smooth interpolation last→first waypoint.

## Recording

- Collect location every `AppConstants.LocationConstants.UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS` ms.
- Simplify via Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (epsilon = `AppConstants.LocationConstants.RDP_SIMPLIFICATION_EPSILON_METERS` m).
- Save on stop.

## Hot Routes

Settings → Routes → "Show hot routes" toggle (default off). When enabled, upserts curated GPX-based routes into the routes DB. When disabled, removes only entries this feature inserted.

Key files: `:core:data/RouteRepository.kt` (`HOT_ROUTES` list + `upsertHotRoutes`/`removeHotRoutes`), `:core:datastore/AppPreferencesDataSource.kt` (`hot_routes_enabled` key)

**Upsert rule**: match by name + city. IDs prefixed with `hot_route_`. If a route with same name already exists, coordinates are updated and original ID is preserved.

**Remove rule**: delete all routes whose ID starts with `hot_route_`.

**Export/import**: `hotRoutesEnabled` + `selectedHotRouteIds` fields in `ExportData`. Importing a backup with it `true` re-applies the upsert.

Route assets are bundled GPX files under `assets/hot_routes/`. All hot routes are saved as `RouteType.STRAIGHT` or `RouteType.GUIDED` depending on the asset.

## Edge Cases

- <2 waypoints → replay disabled.
- Resume after restart: persist waypoint index in DataStore.
