## Documentation Maintenance Policy

Work is NOT complete until affected docs are updated. These files must stay in sync with the code:

| File | Update when |
|------|-------------|
| `AGENTS.md` (this file) — feature table | Adding or removing a feature |
| `AGENTS.md` — module table in `docs/architecture.md` | Adding or removing a Gradle module |
| `AGENTS.md` — Key Services table | Adding, removing, or renaming a service or singleton |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Module added/removed or architecture pattern changes |
| `docs/domain-models.md` | Any change to `core/model/` data classes or enums |
| `docs/features/<feature>.md` | Behaviour change in the corresponding feature |
| `docs/features/export-import.md` | Any change to `ExportData` fields or import/export scope |
| `README.md` — feature table | Adding or removing a user-visible feature |
| `README.md` — module table | Adding or removing a Gradle module |
| `docs/wiki/<feature>.html` | Adding or changing any user-visible feature |
| `docs/wiki/changelog.html` | Any release with user-visible changes |

Rules:
- New feature → create `docs/features/<feature>.md` AND add row to AGENTS.md feature table AND README.md feature table.
- New Gradle module → add row to `docs/architecture.md` module table AND README.md module table.
- New domain model or field → update `docs/domain-models.md`.
- Deleted feature/module → remove from all tables above.
- Doc changes go in the same commit as the code change, not a follow-up.
- New user-visible feature → create `docs/wiki/<feature>.html` AND add it to `NAV_ITEMS` in `docs/wiki/wiki-init.js`. Follow `docs/wiki/CONTRIBUTING.md` for page structure, nav ordering, and writing style. Wiki pages are for **app users, not developers** — no code symbols, class names, Android internals, or library names.
- Wiki prose must pass the audience test in `docs/wiki/CONTRIBUTING.md`: could a non-technical user understand every sentence? If not, rewrite.

## Pre-Commit Validation Policy

Work is NOT complete until lint and test passes.

```bash
make format
make lint
make test
```

To verify the AAB builds locally (manual Play Store upload — no automated CI deployment):

```bash
make bundle
```

Rules:
- Fix every lint error before declaring done. Warnings acceptable; errors not.
- Run after every set of edits, not just end of session.
- If check fails, fix root cause. Don't suppress unless genuine false positive + inline comment explaining why.
- Never suppress `Errors` category rules. Never batch-suppress with `@file:Suppress`.
- Never add co-authoring or "Claude-Sessions" to the commit

## Key Services

| Service | Module | Type | Purpose |
|---------|--------|------|---------|
| `MockLocationService` | `:core:location` | ForegroundService | Owns `LocationManager` test provider. Exposes `StateFlow<SpoofState>`. Commands: `startSpoofing`, `updatePosition`, `stopSpoofing`. Suspended-phase state held in `AtomicReference<SuspendedPhaseState>`; transitions via `advanceSuspendedPhase()` pure function (testable independently). |
| `JoystickOverlayService` | `:feature:joystick:impl` | Service | Extends `OverlayService`. Manages `WindowManager` overlay. Reads joystick input → `LocationRepository.updatePosition()`. |
| `FloatingWidgetService` | `:feature:widget:impl` | Service | Manages widget overlay. Binds to `MockLocationService`. |
| `RoamingEngine` | `:core:routing` | Class (not service) | Instantiated by `MockLocationService`. Owns OSRM client + random waypoint picker. Runs on service scope. |
| `ReplayOrchestrator` | `:core:location` | Class (not service) | Instantiated by `MockLocationService`. Owns all route-replay and walk-to orchestration (`handleStart`/`handlePause`/`handleResume`/`handleStop`/`handleCancel`) extracted from the service. Communicates back via lambdas (`onStateChange`, `onPositionChange`, `pushLocationUpdate`, etc.) instead of holding its own state directly. |
| `FollowerCatchUpCoordinator` | `:core:location` | Class (not service) | Instantiated by `MockLocationService`. Owns the FOLLOWER-mode catch-up target (`AtomicReference<LatLng?>`) extracted from the service, mirroring the `WalkCoordinator` pattern — state ownership + per-tick step logic (`advance()`) live in one small class instead of scattered `@Volatile` fields on the service. |
| `EphemeralReplayController` | `:core:location` | Class (`@Singleton`) | Owns the walk→ephemeral-replay transition. Injected by both `MapViewModel` and `FloatingWidgetService`. `addWaypoint()` decides whether to start a new ephemeral replay (walk→replay transition) or append to an existing one. Eliminates duplicated state-machine logic across call sites. |
| `WalkCoordinator` | `:core:data` | Class (`@Singleton`) | Thin facade over `WalkToEngine`. Cancels any in-flight walk before starting a new one, forwards position ticks to `LocationRepository`, clears `walkTarget` on arrival or cancellation. |
| `ActivityStateRepository` | `:core:data` | Repository (`@Singleton`) | Single source of truth for unified pause state across all movement modes. Exposes `isActivityPaused: Flow<Boolean>` combining walk-to, route replay, and roaming pause. Prefer over manually combining individual flows from `LocationRepository` and `RoamingRepository`. |

### Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/wiki/index.html` | Overview + card grid + quick start |
| `docs/wiki/home.html` | Home screen + background service |
| `docs/wiki/map.html` | Map screen + bottom sheets |
| `docs/wiki/routes.html` | Routes list + creator + detail |
| `docs/wiki/favorites.html` | Favorites list + map picker |
| `docs/wiki/share.html` | Share & deep link URL reference |
| `docs/wiki/settings.html` | Settings + QR transfer |
| `docs/wiki/overlays.html` | Joystick + widget overlays |
| `docs/wiki/onboarding.html` | First-run setup + troubleshooting |
| `docs/wiki/style.css` | Single stylesheet — all pages share it |
| `docs/wiki/screenshots/` | Phone screenshots (PNG, numbered 01–15) |

### Regenerating screenshots

Screenshots are captured from a connected device/emulator via:

```bash
make screenshot   # outputs to docs/wiki/screenshots/
```

The script (`scripts/screenshot-gallery.sh`) navigates the app and captures all 15 canonical screens. Re-run after any UI change. Commit updated PNGs alongside the code change.

Missing screenshots (14 `joystick_overlay`, 15 `widget_overlay`) require the overlay services running — capture manually if the script can't reach them.

### Maintaining content

- Each HTML page maps 1-to-1 to a feature. Update the page when the feature changes.
- Screenshots are referenced by number (`01_idle.png` … `15_widget_overlay.png`). Renaming a file breaks the page — update both together.
- All pages use the same sidebar nav snippet. When adding a new page, add its `<a>` entry to the `<nav>` block in **every** HTML file.
- No external resources — no CDN fonts, no JS libraries. Keep it that way.

### Design changes

Invoke `/frontend-design:frontend-design` for any visual redesign or layout iteration. The skill owns aesthetic decisions; pass the desired direction and constraints as arguments. After the skill runs, verify with `make wiki-serve` and check all pages render correctly.
