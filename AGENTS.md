| Package | `com.locationjoystick.app` |
| Language | Kotlin |
| UI | Jetpack Compose |
| Min SDK | API 31 |
| Distribution | GitHub Releases APK + Play Store (AAB) |
| Storage | Room + DataStore |
| Backend | None |
| Open source | Yes |

- No accounts
- All data on-device in Room + DataStore

---

## Pre-Commit Validation Policy

Work is NOT complete until lint and test passes.

```bash
make format
make lint
make test
```

To verify the AAB builds locally (manual Play Store upload — no automated CI deployment):

```bash
make bundle
```

Rules:
- Fix every lint error before declaring done. Warnings acceptable; errors not.
- Run after every set of edits, not just end of session.
- If check fails, fix root cause. Don't suppress unless genuine false positive + inline comment explaining why.
- Never suppress `Errors` category rules. Never batch-suppress with `@file:Suppress`.

## Code Exploration Policy

Always use jCodemunch-MCP tools for code navigation. Never fall back to Read, Grep, Glob, or Bash for code exploration.
**Exception:** Use `Read` when editing — harness requires `Read` before `Edit`/`Write` succeeds. Use jCodemunch tools to find/understand code, then `Read` only file you're about to modify.

**Start any session:**
1. `resolve_repo { "path": "." }` — confirm project indexed. If not: `index_folder { "path": "." }`
2. `suggest_queries` — when repo unfamiliar

**Finding code:**
- symbol by name → `search_symbols` (add `kind=`, `language=`, `file_pattern=`, `decorator=` to narrow)
- decorator-aware queries → `search_symbols(decorator="X")` to find symbols with specific decorator (e.g. `@property`, `@route`); combine with set-difference to find symbols *lacking* decorator
- string, comment, config value → `search_text` (supports regex, `context_lines`)
- database columns (dbt/SQLMesh) → `search_columns`

**Reading code:**
- before opening any file → `get_file_outline` first
- one or more symbols → `get_symbol_source` (single ID → flat object; array → batch)
- symbol + imports → `get_context_bundle`
- specific line range only → `get_file_content` (last resort)

**Repo structure:**
- `get_repo_outline` → dirs, languages, symbol counts
- `get_file_tree` → file layout, filter with `path_prefix`

**Relationships & impact:**
- what imports this file → `find_importers`
- where name used → `find_references`
- identifier used anywhere → `check_references`
- file dependency graph → `get_dependency_graph`
- what breaks if change X → `get_blast_radius`
- symbols changed since last commit → `get_changed_symbols`
- dead code → `find_dead_code`
- class hierarchy → `get_class_hierarchy`

## Session-Aware Routing

**Opening move:**
1. `plan_turn { "repo": "...", "query": "your task description", "model": "<your-model-id>" }` — get confidence + recommended files; `model` narrows exposed tool list at zero extra requests.
2. Obey confidence level:
   - `high` → go directly to recommended symbols, max 2 supplementary reads
   - `medium` → explore recommended files, max 5 supplementary reads
   - `low` → feature likely doesn't exist. Report gap. Do NOT search further.

**Interpreting search results:**
- `search_symbols` returns `negative_evidence` with `verdict: "no_implementation_found"`:
  - Do NOT re-search with different terms
  - Do NOT assume related file implements missing feature
  - DO report: "No existing implementation found for X. This would need to be created."
  - DO check `related_existing` files
- `verdict: "low_confidence_matches"`: examine matches critically before assuming they implement feature

**After editing files:**
- PostToolUse hooks installed (Claude Code only): edited files auto-reindexed
- Otherwise: call `register_edit` with edited file paths to invalidate caches
- Bulk edits (5+ files): always use `register_edit` with all paths

**Token efficiency:**
- `_meta` contains `budget_warning`: stop exploring, work with what you have
- `auto_compacted: true`: results auto-compressed due to turn budget
- Use `get_session_context` to check what you've already read — avoid re-reading

## Model-Driven Tool Tiering

jcodemunch-mcp narrows exposed tool list based on model. Always include `model="<your-model-id>"` in opening `plan_turn`.

Replace `<your-model-id>` with active model:
- Claude Opus variants → `claude-opus-4-7` (or any `claude-opus-*`)
- Claude Sonnet variants → `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Claude Haiku variants → `claude-haiku-4-5`
- GPT-4o / GPT-5 / o1 / Llama → use model id as printed by runner

`model=` rides on existing `plan_turn` call — does **not** add separate invocation. If `plan_turn` not appropriate for non-code task, call `announce_model(model="...")` once instead.

## Key Services

| Service | Module | Type | Purpose |
|---------|--------|------|---------|
| `MockLocationService` | `:core:location` | ForegroundService | Owns `LocationManager` test provider. Exposes `StateFlow<SpoofState>`. Commands: `startSpoofing`, `updatePosition`, `stopSpoofing`. Suspended-phase state held in `AtomicReference<SuspendedPhaseState>`; transitions via `advanceSuspendedPhase()` pure function (testable independently). |
| `JoystickOverlayService` | `:feature:joystick:impl` | Service | Extends `OverlayService`. Manages `WindowManager` overlay. Reads joystick input → `LocationRepository.updatePosition()`. |
| `FloatingWidgetService` | `:feature:widget:impl` | Service | Manages widget overlay. Binds to `MockLocationService`. |
| `RoamingEngine` | `:core:routing` | Class (not service) | Instantiated by `MockLocationService`. Owns OSRM client + random waypoint picker. Runs on service scope. |

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: Project has knowledge graph. ALWAYS use code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE Grep/Glob/Read.** Graph faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), gives structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) file scanning can't.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. Graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
